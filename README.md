# Marca-hypertext-highlight

Code highlighting for
[Marca-hypertext](https://github.com/sdangelo/marca-hypertext) based on
[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).

I am too lazy to explain hows and whys.

## TODO

* splitElem() with begin and end;
* make line splitting optional?
* overlapping markup is painful... what to do?
* allow interfacing with other highlighters/parsers;
* use Marca as highlighters/parsers output rather than HTML?
* otherwise implement full list of HTML entities decoding?
* allow non-span elements in HTML output?
* browserification;
* more DRY;
* API review;
* documentation;
* tests.
